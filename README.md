- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EB-Walton, a longtime educator in math and statistics, although in academia apparently teaching stats for 15+ years doesn't make you "qualified" for it
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about data science and how it can be applied efficiently and effectvily.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently jumping through hoops like a good monkey to get a data science degree
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: shoot me a message through here.
